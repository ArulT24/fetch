1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
    I used HashMap to store the payer and their respective balances because it is the easiest structure to access values and also takes up the least amount of space.
    Also, it takes less time to access values.
    I used Java because I have the most experience in it and am most familiar with its syntax and data structure.

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
    I think my code has some disadvantages with respect to its time complexity because of the nested for loop in 
    the calcBalance function. However, I think the code is very organized and simple and keeps track of all the 
    data efficiently. 

3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
    My favorite personal project has been an app that kept track of a persons stocks and made predictions based
    on historical and present day data and news. It was challenging because it was the first time that I 
    had to manage and organize my own project with little help, and was my introduction to Flutter and Firebase.
